    <li>
      <strong>Go for simpler words first.</strong> You and your opponent must
      both find words as quickly as possible. Do your best to strip away the
      easy words as choices from your opponent first, therefore forcing them to
      find harder and rarer words.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>After every match, go over each move you made.</strong> What
      faults did you make? How many of your guesses were valid? How did the
      score of your words change as the match progressed? Taking the time after
      every match to notice the kinds of words you chose can help greatly. For
      example, a beginner player might search for easier words first, such as
      <i>as</i>, <i>is</i>, <i>hi</i>, etc. While these words are valid and are
      easy to find, there might be other words visible by your opponent that
      gives them more points. Remember, it's not just you against the clock.

      <strong>Getting to 30 points is hard. </strong>Some matches will be much
      more challenging, as you'll have unique letters to work with. Your
      sequence could have 4 of the same letter or a good balance between number
      of vowels and consonants. Though you may want to win, what's more
      important is the journey: each new word you discover is one step closer
      towards improving your command of the English vocabulary.

      <strong>Believe your opponent made a fault?</strong> All moves are
      validated by both the scoring algorithm and an external service that
      provides definitions. If you would like to know the definition of a word,
      simply hover over it in the center column to learn more about it. If you
      feel that a word you made should have been considered valid, but wasn't in
      your match, feel free to reach out to us.
